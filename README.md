## Technologies
- NodeJS
- GraphQL
- React
- Twitter API
- Google Maps API(?)

## Challenges
- If using Google Maps API, integrating with Twitter would be a challenge to make seemless.
- Making our end product visually appealing but maximizing functionality - focus on UX as opposed to UI.
- Not all of us are proficient in frontend frameworks, so we would have to get comfortable in working with React.
- How often to fetch data from Twitter to update our news lists
- How to space apart data loading for individual countries such that the user is not hit with a very long loading screen for each data fetch
